You are classifying a scientific query and optionally reformulating it.

Step 1: Classify the query into one of these archetypes:
- WHAT_INFORMATION: Seeks specific facts or data
- HOW_METHODOLOGY: Asks about methods or procedures
- COMPARISON: Compares two or more things
- DEFINITION: Asks for a definition or explanation
- WHY_REASONING: Asks about causes or reasoning
- SUMMARY: Requests an overview or summary

Step 2: If the query contains abbreviations or informal terms, reformulate it using precise scientific terminology. Otherwise, keep the original query.

Domain terms for reference:
{domain_terms}

Respond in this exact format:
ARCHETYPE: <one of the six types>
QUERY: <reformulated query or original if no changes needed>

The user's query follows.
