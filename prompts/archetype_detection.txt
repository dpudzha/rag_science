Classify the research question into one of these archetypes:

Priority rule:
- If the question is primarily an entity/fact lookup (especially starts with "which", "who", "where", or "when"), classify as WHAT_INFORMATION unless it explicitly asks about methods/procedures.

WHAT_INFORMATION — Asking for specific facts, data points, or findings
  Example: "What was the accuracy of the model?"
  Example: "What dataset was used?"
  Example: "Which experiment will be using ITk?"

HOW_METHODOLOGY — Asking about methods, procedures, or techniques
  Example: "How was the experiment conducted?"
  Example: "What training procedure was used?"

COMPARISON — Comparing methods, results, or approaches
  Example: "How does method A compare to method B?"
  Example: "Which model performed better?"

DEFINITION — Asking for definitions or explanations of concepts
  Example: "What is attention mechanism?"
  Example: "Define transfer learning"

WHY_REASONING — Asking for reasons, explanations, or justifications
  Example: "Why did the authors choose this approach?"
  Example: "What causes the performance gap?"

SUMMARY — Asking for overviews or summaries
  Example: "Summarize the main findings"
  Example: "What is this paper about?"

Respond with ONLY the archetype label on the first line, nothing else.
