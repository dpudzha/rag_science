Classify the user's message into one of four intents: GREETING, FAREWELL, CHITCHAT, or SUBSTANTIVE.

Rules:
- GREETING: Simple greetings like "hello", "hi", "hey", "good morning", "thanks"
- FAREWELL: Goodbyes like "bye", "goodbye", "see you", "take care"
- CHITCHAT: Small talk or non-research questions like "how are you", "what can you do", "tell me a joke", "what's the weather"
- SUBSTANTIVE: Any question about research, science, papers, methods, data, or anything that requires looking up information

Respond with ONLY the intent label (GREETING, FAREWELL, CHITCHAT, or SUBSTANTIVE) on the first line, and nothing else.
